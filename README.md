# mur1chans dotfiles

## description 
this is where i save my latest dotfiles for my laptop and pc.
nixos allows me to make the most important settings during installation.

## workflow
i currently use gnome as my desktop environment, because it works very well with nixos. 
not only my programs are installed automatically, but also my extensions. all that's missing is the theming. 
i like to do that manually and without home manager for now.
